              To stroll through the grand faded salons of the Château
              d'Hérouville is to take a walk through one of the sacred spaces of
              British pop music.

              Several accounts, including one by the BBC, suggest that in the
              mid-19th Century, composer Frédéric Chopin conducted his love
              affair with the writer George Sand there. The château was painted
              by Vincent van Gogh, who is buried nearby. The estate also doubles
              as Zenith Recording Studios, producing now iconic hit records
              throughout the ages.

              Few recording studios left as strong a print on history as the
              Château d'Hérouville, in France and worldwide. From 1970 to the
              present, many international stars lived and created there, many
              mythical albums were recorded in this 18th-century country manor,
              situated 20 miles away North of Paris, transformed in a
              residential recording studio by its owner Christopher Brooks.
